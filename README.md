ðŸ”’ Setting Up AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) - Documentation ðŸ”‘

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. This documentation provides step-by-step instructions on setting up IAM in your AWS account.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console).
   - Sign in with your AWS account credentials.

2. Navigate to the IAM Dashboard:
   - Once logged in, search for "IAM" in the AWS Management Console search bar, and select "IAM" from the search results.
   - Alternatively, you can find IAM under the "Security, Identity, & Compliance" section in the AWS Management Console.

3. Create an IAM User:
   - In the IAM dashboard, click on "Users" in the left navigation pane.
   - Click on the "Add user" button to create a new IAM user.
   - Enter a username for the new IAM user and select the access type (Programmatic access, AWS Management Console access, or both).
   - Set permissions for the IAM user by attaching policies. You can choose from existing policies or create custom policies based on your requirements.
   - Click on the "Next: Tags" button to add tags (optional).
   - Review the user details and click on the "Create user" button.

4. Create IAM Groups (Optional):
   - IAM groups allow you to manage permissions for multiple users collectively.
   - In the IAM dashboard, click on "Groups" in the left navigation pane.
   - Click on the "Create group" button.
   - Enter a name for the group and attach policies to define permissions.
   - Click on the "Create group" button.

5. Assign IAM Users to Groups (Optional):
   - Once you have created IAM groups and users, you can assign users to groups to inherit permissions.
   - In the IAM dashboard, click on "Users" in the left navigation pane.
   - Select the user you want to add to a group, click on the "Add user to group" button, and choose the desired group.
   - Click on the "Add user to group" button.

6. Set Up IAM Roles (Optional):
   - IAM roles are used to grant permissions to entities that are not IAM users, such as AWS services or external users.
   - In the IAM dashboard, click on "Roles" in the left navigation pane.
   - Click on the "Create role" button.
   - Choose the trusted entity type (AWS service, another AWS account, or a web identity provider).
   - Configure the permissions policy for the role.
   - Review the role details and click on the "Create role" button.

7. Secure Access Keys for IAM Users (Programmatic Access Only):
   - For IAM users with programmatic access, you can generate access keys to interact with AWS programmatically (e.g., using AWS CLI or SDKs).
   - In the IAM dashboard, select the IAM user.
   - Navigate to the "Security credentials" tab.
   - Click on the "Create access key" button to generate access keys.
   - Download the access key file or copy the access key ID and secret access key.

8. Best Practices for IAM Security:
   - Follow the principle of least privilege by granting only the permissions necessary for users, groups, and roles to perform their intended tasks.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security.
   - Regularly review IAM policies, users, groups, and roles to ensure compliance and security best practices.

By following these steps, you can set up AWS IAM to manage access to your AWS resources securely.
